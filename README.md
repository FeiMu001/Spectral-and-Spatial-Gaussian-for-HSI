## 📝 Abstract
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) achieve strong performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) representation but suffer from excessive training memory consumption, low inference efficiency, and poor interpretability, while 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS)–an advanced explicit continuous representation technique for natural images–alleviates these limitations via efficient and interpretable modeling yet focuses solely on spatial continuity, rendering it incompatible with HSIs that require joint spatial-spectral modeling. To bridge this gap, we first develop a 2DGS-based mathematical model for continuous spatial-spectral modeling of HSI, and further propose Spectral and Spatial Gaussian (S2Gaussian) via equivalent decoupling, an explicit continuous spatial-spectral representation framework tailored for HSI with two core components: Spectral Gaussian, which employs 1D Gaussian primitives to enable continuous spectral representation, and Spatial Gaussian, which adopts 2D Gaussian primitives to achieve continuous spatial representation for arbitrary bands while preserving fine-grained spatial details. To mitigate the prohibitive computational complexity of naive 2DGS-based modeling for large-sized, high-dimensional HSIs, we further introduce two key optimizations–a grouping strategy that reduces model parameters by partitioning HSIs into manageable subgroups and a prior-guided parameter pre-training scheme that leverages Global Spectral Prior for Spectral Gaussian and Maximum-Entropy Band Prior for Spatial Gaussian to accelerate convergence and enhance modeling accuracy. Extensive experiments validate S2Gaussian’s exceptional performance: it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in continuous representation tasks and delivers satisfactory performance in downstream compression tasks.
